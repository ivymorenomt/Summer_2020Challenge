    "Feature: is synonymous with terms variable, column, attribute and field\n",
    "Instance: synonymous with the terms row, observation, data point, value, and case(dataset)\n",
    "Target: a target variable is synonymous with the terms predictant and dependent variable\n",
    "Data: the term is used synonymously to refer to a predictor or set of predictor variables - this is what we fee to the machine\n",

    "- Supervised - Making predictions straight from labeled data\n",
    "    - example: an apple, orange and banana are the datasets and name it with appropriate label\n",
    "    - then someone comes in with unknown fruit and asked what is this\n",
    "    - you may guess it is an orange, due to skin type, color, texture..\n",
    "- Unsupervised - Making predictions straight from unlabeled data\n",
    "    - example: they give you 7 fruits unknown and give you 8th.\n",
    "    - try to find the subgroups you were originally given - which is citrus, rose family, and berries. \n",
    "    - similarities of the skin\n",
    "    - then go back to the unknown fruit. which group would it fall into\n",
    "- Semi-Supervised - Uses both labeled and unlabeled data to make a set of predictions\n",
